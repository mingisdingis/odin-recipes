    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mashed potato, mashed potatoes (American and Canadian English) or mashed taters, colloquially known as mash (British English),[2] is a dish made by mashing boiled potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt and pepper. It is generally served as a side dish to meat or vegetables. When the potatoes are only roughly mashed, they are sometimes called smashed potatoes. Dehydrated instant mashed potatoes and frozen mashed potatoes are available. Mashed potatoes are an ingredient in other dishes, such as dumplings and gnocchi.</p>
